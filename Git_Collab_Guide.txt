Steps to follow for the same collaboration 

Absolutely! Let me give you a **clear step-by-step summary** of everything you did, from creating the repo to collaborating and syncing between office and home. I’ll organize it so it’s easy to read next time.

---

## **Step 1: Initial Setup (Office)**

1. You created a **new GitHub repository** on your personal account.

   * While creating, you selected **“Node” in `.gitignore`**.
   * Repo was empty initially.

2. On your **local machine**, you had your **React Native projects**:

   * `Awesome01/`
   * `Styler02/`

3. You created a **`.gitignore`** manually in the root `React_Native/` folder to exclude unwanted files (like `node_modules/`, `.bundle/`, logs, etc.).

---

## **Step 2: Git Configuration**

1. Configured **global Git username & email** for your personal GitHub account:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_personal_email@example.com"
```

2. Initialized Git in the project root (if not already):

```bash
git init
```

3. Added the **remote** for your personal repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Amaanchaudhary/React-native.git
```

---

## **Step 3: Adding Files & Committing**

1. Added `.gitignore` first to stage it:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Initial commit: add gitignore"
```

2. Added the **first project `Awesome01/`**:

```bash
git add Awesome01
git commit -m "Add Awesome01 React Native app"
```

3. Added the **second project `Styler02/`**:

```bash
git add Styler02
git commit -m "Add Styler02 React Native app"
```

4. **Checked commit history**:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

* You could see three commits: `.gitignore`, `Awesome01`, `Styler02`.

---

## **Step 4: Handling GitHub Authentication**

1. Normally GitHub now requires **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for HTTPS authentication instead of passwords.

2. You had already generated a **PAT via your office account** for work repos.

   * But pushing to your personal GitHub account from the office machine worked because **your global config uses your personal GitHub account credentials**.
   * Git cached authentication on your machine, so it didn’t prompt you for a token.

---

## **Step 5: Handling Remote Conflicts**

1. When you tried pushing, Git rejected it:

```
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
```

2. You pulled the remote branch using:

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

3. **Resolved merge conflicts** (mainly `.gitignore`) manually:

   * Edited `.gitignore` to merge contents.
   * Added it back and committed:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Resolve gitignore merge conflict and merge rules"
```

4. Pushed everything finally:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

✅ Now GitHub repo has both projects and merged `.gitignore`.

---

## **Step 6: Working From Home**

1. **Clone the repo to home machine**:

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/Amaanchaudhary/React-native.git
```

2. Navigate into the project you want to work on:

```bash
cd Styler02
npm install    # Install node_modules
npm run android # Start the app
```

3. Make changes, then **commit and push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Worked on Styler02"
git push origin main
```

4. **For new projects**:

   * Create the folder inside `React_Native/`, add code, commit, push.

5. **No need to create branches or pull requests** if you’re working solo on main.

---

## **Step 7: Syncing Between Machines**

Before starting work on any machine:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

* Ensures your local copy is up-to-date with GitHub.

After finishing work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

---

## **Step 8: Cleaning Up Local Changes**

* If Git shows a file as deleted or modified but you didn’t intend:

  * Restore the file:

```bash
git restore <file>
```

* Or if you intentionally deleted it and want to push:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit -m "Remove <file>"
git push
```

---

### ✅ **Key Points You Learned**

1. `.gitignore` helps keep node_modules, builds, logs out of GitHub.
2. Global Git config ensures commits are credited to the right user.
3. GitHub now uses PAT for authentication with HTTPS.
4. Merge conflicts can happen if remote repo has changes; resolve and commit.
5. Pull first, then work → commit → push to avoid conflicts.
6. Solo projects on main branch don’t require pull requests.
7. Always check `git status` before starting work.
